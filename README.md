This is a SIP library for .NET 4.5
This library will add to pjsua (PJSIP version 2.5.5) softphone the ability to integrate with .NET applications.

18/10/2016 - First update.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I uploaded the solution.
This project one-days old, consequently not all the pjsua functionality yet exists.
In addition, not all the code have been tested, use it carefully.

This solution include all the pjsip - http://www.pjsip.org/ libs file and not include any source files.
PJSIP version 2.5.5

My ambition is to continue contribute to this integration solution.
This library is very lightweight and support the last version of pjsip.
Test it and Enjoy.
